# Very brief summary of theory rules:  

## Vowels  

Vowel chords are determined phonetically by lexical set. Some mergers and splits are not accounted for in this readme but will be addressed in the documentation of the completed theory.  
A: "hat", "hard"  
O: "cot", "caught", "sort"  
E: "pet", "there"  
U: "cut", "put", "commA" (weak schwa)*  
EU: "kit", "near", "mornIng" (weak i)*  
*weak vowels can be highly variable depending on accent. The correct vowel chord for a given weak syllable is the one matching whichever strong vowel sounds the closest in your accent, or U in the case of a neutral vowel.  
AE: "they"  
AU: "price", "mouth"  
AEU: "fleece"  
OE: "goat", "goal", "bolt", "cold"  
OU: "goose"  
OEU: "choice"  

The AO chord is never used for phonetic writeouts, leaving it reserved for briefs and such.
